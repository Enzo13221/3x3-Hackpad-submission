## Description

This is my 3x3 hackpad key board submission. I had a lot of fun learning how to use Kicad, Fusion, and other software while designing this. It is really simple just the base project plus extra keys and a bigger box. While working on this project I had one thing in mind and that was moving on to more complex projects.
